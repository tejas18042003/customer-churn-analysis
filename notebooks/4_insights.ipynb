    "4. Monitor high monthly charge customers for churn signals\n",
    "5. Fiber optics when opted for as internet plan has high churn rate indicating an underlying issue which needs to be investigated \n",
    "6. Use churn predictions to drive proactive retention campaigns using the chosen model from the model fitting section due to good RECALL(0.8) which is perfect for churn\n"
