# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## Overview
Customer churn is a critical business problem where organizations aim to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their service so that proactive retention actions can be taken.

This project analyzes customer behavior data and builds an interpretable machine learning model to predict churn. The focus is on the **complete data science lifecycle**: data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, evaluation, and business interpretation.

## Business Problem
**Goal:**  
Predict whether a customer is likely to churn (`Yes` / `No`) based on demographic, service usage, and account information.

**Why it matters:**  
- Retaining existing customers is significantly cheaper than getting new ones  
- Missing a churned customer directly impacts revenue  
- Accurate churn prediction enables targeted retention strategies
